    <h2>BLACK PANTHER</h2>
    <p>A black panther is the melanistic colour variant of the leopard (Panthera pardus) and the jaguar (Panthera
        onca). Black panthers of both species have excess black pigments, but their typical rosettes are also
        present. They have been documented mostly in tropical forests, with black leopards in Africa and Asia, and
        black jaguars in South America. Melanism is caused by a recessive allele in the leopard, and by a dominant
        allele in the jaguar.</p>
